## ðŸ”§ Architecture and Methodologies

### Chat Processing Pipeline
1. **User Input**: Text, voice, or image input is captured
2. **Query Analysis**:
   - Decision between RAG or general knowledge using LLM classification
   - Subject categorization (Compiler Design, Data Analysis, Networking, etc.)
3. **Context Retrieval**:
   - For RAG queries: Vector search in Pinecone for relevant documents
   - Web search for supplementary information
4. **Response Generation**:
   - Selected AI model generates response with provided context
   - Streaming implementation for real-time feedback
5. **Response Rendering**:
   - Markdown parsing and rendering
   - Special handling for code, math, tables

### PDF Generation Process
1. **Content Extraction**: Parse conversation messages
2. **Element Processing**:
   - Identify and extract code blocks, tables, math expressions
   - Process inline styling (bold, italic, strikethrough)
3. **Document Creation**:
   - Configure document properties and styling
   - Render header with logo and metadata
4. **Content Rendering**:
   - Custom rendering for different element types:
     - Headings with proper hierarchy
     - Lists (bulleted and numbered)
     - Code blocks with syntax highlighting
     - Math expressions with proper formatting
     - Tables with aligned columns
     - Blockquotes with styled borders
5. **Finalization**:
   - Add pagination and footer
   - Generate timestamped PDF file

### Vision Processing Pipeline
1. **Image Upload**: Base64 encoding and transmission
2. **Temporary Storage**: Server-side storage for processing
3. **AI Analysis**: Processing via vision-capable models
4. **Result Integration**: Incorporating vision results into the chat

### Voice Processing Pipeline
1. **Audio Capture**: Browser API for microphone access
2. **Audio Transmission**: Sending recorded audio to the server
3. **Transcription**: Converting audio to text via Whisper API
4. **Response**: Optional text-to-speech conversion
